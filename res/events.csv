He's talking!;Podcast host|Today, we continue with the topic of aliens.;Brandon and Katie|Aliens?;Podcast host|That's right, aliens! As I'm sure many of you intelligent folk have noticed, there have been some weird occurrences going on around town.

So here's the clue ""Formula 1 is my favorite sport!"" Meet me there at 7:30 am on the dot! No earlier, no later, or else I'll know you aren't to be trusted!

Hello? Mr. Jenkinson?;Radio Mr. Jenkinson|What are you doing all the way out here little girl? Get lost!;Radio Katie|I'm here for the information you talked about on your podcast.

Since no one else seems to have broken my code I guess you'll have to do.;Brandon|Are you sure it wasn't just that no one else was listening? It really wasn't that hard of a code to crack.;Radio Mr. Jenkinson|Shut up, kid! Anyway as I was saying, my devices have picked up strange signals coming from radio channel 112.1. It seems like the aliens are trying to relay some sort of message but I can't figure out what it is. I've noticed the abnormalities tend to occur at 8:45 am and 2:15 pm going back to static.;Radio Katie|Interesting, can you tell us anything else about these aliens?;Radio Mr. Jenkinson|In case you haven't noticed, they really like corn for some unknown reason. I've been saving some up as a potential bargaining tool in case they should deem us humans inferior and decide to wipe us out. It seems you kids could get better use out of it than I could though.;Radio Katie|Thank you sir.;Radio Mr. Jenkinson|Of course, now get going!

You may have it back as well as the rest of them.;Radio Katie|Oh thank you so much! We've missed Sunny a lot! If you don't mind me asking, why did you need him and all the other dogs anyway?Alien|These creatures are ideal for carrying large amounts of the material you call ""corn"". You see, the reason We are here in the first place is our ship crash-landed here on our way back to our planet. I need this ""corn"" to power our ship and return to our home planet. It would have taken me much longer to get there had it not been for the help of these easily persuaded beasts. Their desire to please for sustenance has no bounds.;Radio Katie|See!
