This show is all about getting to the bottom of all the abnormalities the foolish folks of Westbrook refuse to accept! But not us listeners, not us!;BRANDON|Ok I admit, he's a bit crazy, but he may still know something important!;KATIE|Really Brandon? Just a bit crazy?;BRANDON|Shhhh! He's talking!;PODCAST HOST|Now for today's show we continue with the topic of aliens.;BRANDON AND KATIE|Aliens?;PODCAST HOST|That's right, aliens! As I'm sure many of you intelligent folk have noticed, there have been some weird occurrences going on around town. Corn crops being cut down in the dead of night, weird figures at the town fair and many cannine companions disappearing.;PODCAST HOST|I'm a little too old myself to be chasing down these things so that's why I'm leaving it up to kids. If you're interested in having access to my wealth of knowledge, come to my home and we'll discuss things. I'll have to disguise my location as I don't want the government finding me... again. But meet me at 8 and H at dawn! No earlier, no later or else I'll know you aren't to be trusted! That's all I can say for now dear listeners. So remember, keep your eyes open...;BRANDON|What could he mean by 8 and H?;KATIE|I don't know but I know for a fact I am not looking forward to meeting this crazy guy once we figure it out.",,008_map,104,,EE23:00

There's a house all the way out here.;BRANDON|Do you see Mr. Jenkinson?;RADIO KATIE|I think I see him sitting on the front porch there. Looks like he has a shotgun in his lap. Do you think it's safe?;BRANDON|I think so. He's the one that gave away the coordinates to his house. We figured it out and you're there at the time he said.;RADIO KATIE|Well, here goes nothing... Hello? Mr. Jenkinson?;RADIO MR. JENKINSON|What are you doing all the way out here little girl? Get lost!;RADIO KATIE|I'm here for the information you talked about on your podcast. My brother and I followed your clues out here.;RADIO MR. JENKINSON|Ah, is that so? Well, come on and get inside. We can't have the government listening in on this conversation.;RADIO KATIE|The government?;RADIO MR. JENKINSON|Yes, yes. I've put tin foil in the insulation so their listening devices can't penetrate the walls. Now come on.;RADIO KATIE|Uh, alright...;RADIO MR. JENKINSON|Now, where's this brother of yours?;RADIO KATIE|He's listening in on the radio. I'm the field agent and he's my intelligence.;BRANDON|Hi, Mr. Jenkinson...;RADIO MR. JENKINSON|Well aren't you kids cute! Since no one else seems to have broken my code I guess you'll have to do.;BRANDON|Are you sure it wasn't just that no one else was listening? It really wasn't that hard of a code to crack.;RADIO MR. JENKINSON|Shut up kid! Anyway as I was saying, my devices have picked up strange signals coming from radio channel 146.1. It seems like the aliens are trying to relay some sort of message but I can't figure out what it is. I've noticed the abnormalities tend to occur at 3:33 am and 9:24pm before returning back to static.;RADIO KATIE|Interesting, can you tell us anything else about these aliens?;RADIO MR. JENKINSON|Well in case you haven't noticed, they really like corn for some unknown reason. I've been saving some up as a potential bargaining tool in case they should deam us humans inferior and decide to wipe us out. It seems you kids could get better use out of it than I could though.;RADIO KATIE|Thank you sir.;RADIO MR. JENKINSON|Of course, now get going! I have other important conspiracy matters to attend to!;BRANDON|Well that was helpful! Head back to the treehouse and we'll figure this radio signal code out.",,009_radio,,"f,1",EE9:00

I have this corn for you...? ;ALIEN| Thank you small one. We will gladly accept this offering. We are no longer in need of your furry beast companion anyway. You may have it back as well of the rest of them. ;RADIO KATIE| Oh thank you so much! We've missed Sunny a lot! If you don't mind me asking, why did you need him and all the other dogs anyway?;ALIEN| These creatures are ideal for carrying large amounts of the material you call ""corn"". You see, the reason We are here in the first place is our ship crash landed here on our way back to our planet. I need this ""corn"" to power our ship and return to our home planet. It would have taken me much longer to get there had it not been for the help of these easily persuaded beasts. Their desire to please for sustinence has no bounds.;RADIO KATIE| See! I told you Brandon! ;BRANDON| Whatever! But wait, why did you keep leaving clues for us to find if you just wanted to get home? ;ALIEN| I was intrigued by your intellect and wanted to test the limits of your minds. But now I must be going. This is the last material component I need to get back home. Goodbye human hatchlings. ;BRANDON|That was amazing Katie! Did you get all that on video?;RADIO KATIE| Yes I- oh no! I forgot to press record! No one will ever believe us now!;BRANDON| It's ok, what matters is that we have Sunny back!
